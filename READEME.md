# NVIM Configrations

This configuration was created while following ThePrimeagen's video [0 to LSP: Neovim RC from Scratch](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)

You will first need to install ripgrep, vim, neovim (>= 0.8x), and packer. Then, source the files and run `:PackerSync`
